# QR Code Component — Frontend Mentor

## Description

This project is a solution for the [Frontend Mentor | QR code component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) challenge.

The goal was to build a responsive QR code component as close to the design as possible. The project uses pure HTML and CSS (normalize.css + main.css) and the Outfit font from Google Fonts. All elements are implemented according to the original layout.
